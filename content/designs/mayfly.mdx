Mayfly was a proposed project for creating virtual clusters natively within Kubernetes. The project would have spun off some of Uffizzi's core functionality into a standalone tool to provide off-the-shelf ephemeral environments capabilities with minimal effort. This project was never completed, but I completed some of the design work to support the product.
